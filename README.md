# mobile_trip_planner

Mobile Trip Planner is a mobile app written in Dart language with a Flutter framework. This app is my personal project for my studies. It allows user to completely plan a trip ex. : pick a destination, choose dates, add notes from the journey, store tickets and reservations etc. This app is still in development.
